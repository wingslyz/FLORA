## Abstract
Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) leverages the robust representation learning and remarkable generalization ability of large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMS) into federated learning through prompt learning. Existing FPL methods attempt to address data heterogeneity via model personalization. However, excessive personalization leads to the compromise of modelâ€™s generalization ability, which remains a significant challenge to achieve a balance between personalization and generalization under high data heterogeneity. To address this challenge, we propose FLORA, a novel framework that combines orthogonal low-rank adaptation withattention-guided client adapter. Specifically, each client personalizes global prompt through orthogonal low-rank adaptation term, thereby achieving efficient local adaptation while maintaining the generalization of the global prompt. In addition, we introduce a lightweight attention-based adapter for the image encoder, which can enhance cross-modal alignment under nonindependent and nonidentically distributed (Non-IID) environment to further achieve the balance. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that our FLORA achieves superiority performance in balancing generalization and personalization over state-of-the-art methods under high data heterogeneity.

## Requirement
